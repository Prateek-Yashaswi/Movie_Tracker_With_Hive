# Implementation üìó

The Application Has A Google Sign In (Which Is Must Before Continuing Any Further) Feature And An Inbuilt Way To Look For The Details Of Any Movie By Using An HTTP Request To An API. From There You Can Grab The Poster Link And See Other Details (Which Can be Added To Hive Local Storage If Needed). Then You Can Go To The Hive Local Storage And Enter The Data Like Name, Poster Link (You Have Copied), Director Name And You Can Add It To Hive. You Can View, Add, Edit Or Delete This Stored Data With The Help Of A Form And With Interactive Buttons. You Can Also Visit The Added Link In The Hive Through Your Web Browser To View The Full Size Of The Poster And Download It With A Click Of A Button.
